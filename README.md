## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed & running properly on your server:

- Docker Desktop
- WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) if the server OS is Windows

## Other Docs

Head to other deployment readme files: -

- [RabbitMQ](Documentations/RABBITMQ.md)
- [Redis with Management GUI](Documentations/REDIS.md)
- [PostgreSQL with PgAdmin](Documentations/POSTGRESQL.md)
- [Keycloak with Nginx & Postgres](Documentations/KEYCLOAK.md)

## Setting Up the Project

### Generate SSL Certificate

To obtain a valid SSL certificate for your server, open bash terminal and run the following command:

```
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server.key.pem -out server.crt.pem
```

This will generate two files on the home directory of the server:
- SSL certificate file (`server.key.pem`)
- SSL certificate key file (`server.crt.pem`)

### Set Environment Variables for Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` file requires proper environment variables set before execution.

Following the `.env.example` file, create another file `.env` in the same directory, and set proper values. DO NOT expose them!

## Set Environment Variables for API development

<i>Skip this if you are not developing API or writing code and debug.</i>

Open Developer PowerShell from project root directory & run the following commands:

```
setx API__ConnectionStrings__DatabaseConnectionString "<connection_string_here>"
setx API__ClientApplication__AllowedOrigins "http://localhost:3000" (if frontend is running on this domain)
setx API__Keycloak__Host "http://localhost:9990"
setx API__Keycloak__Realm "RideSharing"
```

## Running the Containers

### Production Environment

Open Terminal from project root directory and run the following command to run all containers in detached mode:

```
docker compose up -d
```

### Development Environment

Open Terminal from project root directory and run the following command to run all containers in detached mode:

```
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

## Usage

### Access APIs
- Access RideSharing API through `https:localhost:4000`.
  `GET https://localhost:4000` returns <i>`RideSharing.API is running`</i> message.
  
- Access RideSharing Customer API through `https:localhost:5000`.
  `GET https://localhost:5000` returns <i>`RideSharing.CustomerAPI is running`</i> message.

### Access MailHog

- Access Local MailHog Server through `http://localhost:8025`(only for dev env).

## Destroying the Containers

Run the following command to destroy all containers:

```
docker compose down
```
